**Note:** All keyboard shortcuts can be customized by editing the `keyboardShortcuts` section in `.obsidian/plugins/notebook-navigator/data.json`. You can add VIM-style navigation (h,j,k,l) or assign multiple keys to the same command.

## 6 Commands

Set custom hotkeys for these commands in Obsidian's Hotkeys settings:

**View & navigation**

- `Notebook Navigator: Open` Opens Notebook Navigator in left sidebar. If already open, focuses the file list pane. **Suggestion:** Bind to a shortcut key like `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+E` to move keyboard focus to the list pane - **this is essential for full keyboard navigation**
- `Notebook Navigator: Open homepage` Opens the Notebook Navigator view and loads the homepage file configured in settings
- `Notebook Navigator: Select vault profile` Opens modal to switch between vault profiles
- `Notebook Navigator: Reveal file` Reveals current file in navigator. Expands parent folders and scrolls to file. This command is useful if you have the setting `Auto-reveal active note` switched off and want to reveal notes manually
- `Notebook Navigator: Navigate to folder` Search dialog to jump to any folder
- `Notebook Navigator: Navigate to tag` Search dialog to jump to any tag
- `Notebook Navigator: Add to shortcuts` Adds the current file, folder, or tag to shortcuts
- `Notebook Navigator: Open shortcut 1-9` Opens shortcut by its position in the shortcuts list
- `Notebook Navigator: Search` Opens quick search field or focuses it if already open. Search persists between sessions. **Suggestion:** Bind to a shortcut key like `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F` for quick file filtering

**Selection**

- `Notebook Navigator: Select next file` Moves selection to the next file in the current folder or tag view.
- `Notebook Navigator: Select previous file` Moves selection to the previous file in the current folder or tag view.

**Layout & display**

- `Notebook Navigator: Toggle dual pane layout` Toggle single/dual-pane layout (desktop)
- `Notebook Navigator: Toggle descendants` Toggle descendants notes display for both folders and tags. **Suggestion:** Bind to a shortcut key like `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+S` to quickly toggle display of notes from descendants
- `Notebook Navigator: Toggle hidden items` Show or hide hidden folders, tags, and notes
- `Notebook Navigator: Toggle tag sort` Toggle between alphabetical and frequency-based tag sorting
- `Notebook Navigator: Collapse / expand all items` Collapse or expand all items based on the current state. When `Keep selected item expanded` is enabled (default on), all folders except the current one will be collapsed. This is super handy to keep the navigation tree tidy when searching for documents. **Suggestion:** Bind to a shortcut key like `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+C` to quickly collapse non-selected items

**File operations**

**Note:** When creating new notes in Obsidian you can choose the `Default location for new notes` in Obsidian settings. This can be the the root folder, same folder as current file, or a specific folder. When working with Notebook Navigator, especially with the setting `Show notes from descendants` enabled, none of these options are preferred. Instead you always want to create new notes in the currently selected folder (for example if you have `Show notes from descendants` on, and have a note in a descendant folder selected, you do not want the new note to appear in the descendant folder). The same also applies to moving and deleting files. This is why you should use these commands instead of the built-in Obsidian commands when using Notebook Navigator.

- `Notebook Navigator: Create new note` Create note in currently selected folder. **Suggestion:** Bind `Cmd/Ctrl+N` to this command (unbind from Obsidian's default "Create new note" first)
- `Notebook Navigator: Create new note from template` Create note from template in currently selected folder (requires Templater)
- `Notebook Navigator: Move files` Move selected files to another folder. Selects next file in current folder
- `Notebook Navigator: Convert to folder note` Create a folder matching the file name and move the file inside as the folder note
- `Notebook Navigator: Set as folder note` Rename the active file to its folder note name
- `Notebook Navigator: Detach folder note` Detach the folder note in the selected folder and rename it
- `Notebook Navigator: Pin all folder notes` Add all folder notes to shortcuts. Command only visible when folder notes are enabled and at least one unpinned folder note exists
- `Notebook Navigator: Delete files` Delete selected files. Selects next file in current folder

**Tag operations**

- `Notebook Navigator: Add tag to selected files` Dialog to add tag to selected files. Supports creating new tags
- `Notebook Navigator: Remove tag from selected files` Dialog to remove specific tag. Removes immediately if only one tag
- `Notebook Navigator: Remove all tags from selected files` Clear all tags from selected files with confirmation

**Maintenance**

- `Notebook Navigator: Rebuild cache` Rebuilds the local Notebook Navigator cache. Use this if you experience missing tags, incorrect previews or missing feature images
