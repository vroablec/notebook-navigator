## 5 Synced and local settings

Many settings in Notebook Navigator display a sync toggle — a cloud icon that switches between "Enable sync" and "Disable sync". This controls where each setting is stored and whether it is shared across devices.

### 5.1 How sync works

Obsidian plugins store their configuration in `data.json`, located at `.obsidian/plugins/notebook-navigator/data.json` inside your vault folder. When you use a sync service — such as [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync), iCloud, GitHub, Dropbox, or Google Drive — this file is synchronized across all your devices along with the rest of your vault. Any setting saved to `data.json` will propagate to every device that syncs the vault.

When sync is **enabled** (default) for a setting, the value is saved to `data.json` and synchronized to all devices through your sync service.

When sync is **disabled** for a setting, the value is saved to Obsidian's local storage instead. Local storage is device-specific and is not included in vault sync. The setting will have its own independent value on each device. When you disable sync for a setting, the current value is copied to local storage on the current device, and the value is removed from `data.json` to prevent it from overriding local values on other devices.

If you do not use a sync service, the sync toggle has no practical effect since `data.json` is only stored locally.

## 6 Search

Notebook Navigator has two search modes: filter search and Omnisearch. Switch between them using the up/down arrow keys or by clicking the search icon. Combine file names, properties, tags, dates, and filters in one query (e.g., `meeting .status=active #work @thisweek`).

### 6.1 Filter search

Filters files by name, tags, properties, dates, folders, extensions, and tasks within the current folder and subfolders. Default search mode.

**File names**

- `word` - Match notes with "word" in the file name
- `word1 word2` - Require every word to match the file name
- `-word` - Exclude notes with "word" in the file name

**Tags**

- `#tag` - Include notes with tag (also matches nested tags like `#tag/subtag`)
- `#` - Include only tagged notes
- `-#tag` - Exclude notes with tag
- `-#` - Include only untagged notes
- `#tag1 #tag2` - Match both tags (implicit AND)
- `#tag1 AND #tag2` - Match both tags (explicit AND)
- `#tag1 OR #tag2` - Match either tag
- `#a OR #b AND #c` - AND has higher precedence: matches `#a`, or both `#b` and `#c`
- Cmd/Ctrl+Click a tag to add with AND. Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Click to add with OR

**Properties**

- `.key` - Include notes with property key
- `.key=value` - Include notes with property value
- `."Reading Status"` - Property key with whitespace (double-quoted)
- `."Reading Status"="In Progress"` - Keys and values with whitespace must be double-quoted
- `-.key` - Exclude notes with property key
- `-.key=value` - Exclude notes with property value
- Cmd/Ctrl+Click a property to add with AND. Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Click to add with OR

**Filters**

- `has:task` - Include notes with unfinished tasks
- `-has:task` - Exclude notes with unfinished tasks
- `folder:meetings` - Include notes where a folder name contains `meetings`
- `folder:/work/meetings` - Include notes only in `work/meetings` (not subfolders)
- `folder:/` - Include notes only in the vault root
- `-folder:archive` - Exclude notes where a folder name contains `archive`
- `-folder:/archive` - Exclude notes only in `archive` (not subfolders)
- `ext:md` - Include notes with extension `md` (`ext:.md` is also supported)
- `-ext:pdf` - Exclude notes with extension `pdf`
- Combine with tags, names, and dates (e.g., `folder:/work/meetings ext:md @thisweek`)

**Dates**

- `@today` - Match notes from today using the default date field
- `@yesterday`, `@last7d`, `@last30d`, `@thisweek`, `@thismonth` - Relative date ranges
- `@2026-02-07` - Match a single day (also supports `@20260207`)
- `@2026` - Match a calendar year
- `@2026-02` or `@202602` - Match a calendar month
- `@2026-W05` or `@2026W05` - Match an ISO week
- `@2026-Q2` or `@2026Q2` - Match a calendar quarter
- `@13/02/2026` - Numeric formats with separators (`@07022026` follows your locale when ambiguous)
- `@2026-02-01..2026-02-07` - Match an inclusive day range (open ends supported)
- `@c:...` or `@m:...` - Target created or modified date
- `-@...` - Exclude a date match

The default date field follows the current sort order. When sorting by name, the date field is configured in Settings → Notes → Date → When sorting by name.

**AND/OR behavior**

`AND` and `OR` operators work in tag/property-only queries (queries that contain only `#tag`, `-#tag`, `#`, `-#`, `.key`, `-.key`, `.key=value`, or `-.key=value` filters). If the query also includes names, dates, task filters, folder filters, or extension filters, `AND` and `OR` are matched as file name words instead.

- Operator query: `#work OR .status=started`
- Mixed query: `#work OR ext:md` (`OR` is matched in file names)

### 6.2 Omnisearch

Full-text search across the vault, filtered to the current folder, subfolders, or selected tags. Requires the [Omnisearch](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-omnisearch) plugin. If Omnisearch is not installed, search falls back to filter search.

Note previews show Omnisearch result excerpts instead of the default preview text.

**Known limitations**

- **Performance** - Can be slow when searching for fewer than 3 characters in large vaults
- **Path bug** - Cannot search in paths with non-ASCII characters and does not search subpaths correctly
- **Limited results** - Omnisearch searches the entire vault and returns a limited number of results before filtering, so relevant files from the current folder may not appear if many matches exist elsewhere
- **Preview text** - Note previews are replaced with Omnisearch result excerpts, which may not show the actual search match highlight if it appears elsewhere in the file

## 7 Custom hotkeys

Edit `.obsidian/plugins/notebook-navigator/data.json` to customize Notebook Navigator hotkeys. Open the file and locate the `keyboardShortcuts` section. Each entry maps an action to one or more key bindings:

```json
"pane:move-up": [ { "key": "ArrowUp", "modifiers": [] }, { "key": "K", "modifiers": [] } ]
```

Add multiple bindings per action to support alternate keys, like the `ArrowUp` and `K` example above. Combine modifiers in one entry by listing each value, for example `"modifiers": ["Mod", "Shift"]`. Keyboard sequences such as `gg` or `dd` are not supported. Reload Obsidian after editing the file.

### 7.1 Modifiers

| Modifier | Key                                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `Mod`    | Cmd (macOS) / Ctrl (Win/Linux)            |
| `Alt`    | Alt / Option                              |
| `Shift`  | Shift                                     |
| `Ctrl`   | Control (prefer `Mod` for cross-platform) |

### 7.2 Available actions

| Action                            | Default key(s)       |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------- |

## 8 Commands

Set custom hotkeys for these commands in Obsidian's Hotkeys settings:

**View & navigation**

- `Notebook Navigator: Open` Opens Notebook Navigator in left sidebar. If already open, moves keyboard focus over to the list pane. **Suggestion:** Bind to a shortcut key like `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+E` to move keyboard focus to the list pane - **this is essential for full keyboard navigation**
- `Notebook Navigator: Toggle left sidebar` Toggles the left sidebar. When opening, sets the left sidebar view to Notebook Navigator (unlike Obsidian's built-in "Toggle left sidebar" command which restores the previous left sidebar view)
- `Notebook Navigator: Open homepage` Opens the Notebook Navigator view and loads the homepage file configured in settings
- `Notebook Navigator: Select vault profile` Opens modal to switch between vault profiles
- `Notebook Navigator: Reveal file` Reveals current file in navigator. Expands parent folders and scrolls to file. This command is useful if you have the setting `Auto-reveal active note` switched off and want to reveal notes manually. **Suggestion:** Bind to a shortcut key like `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+R` to quickly change the selected folder or tag to the current file
- `Notebook Navigator: Open all files` Opens all notes in the currently selected folder or tag. When opening 15 or more files, shows a confirmation dialog
- `Notebook Navigator: Navigate to folder` Search dialog to jump to any folder
- `Notebook Navigator: Navigate to tag` Search dialog to jump to any tag
- `Notebook Navigator: Add to shortcuts` Adds the current file, folder, or tag to shortcuts
- `Notebook Navigator: Open shortcut 1-9` Opens shortcut by its position in the shortcuts list
- `Notebook Navigator: Search` Opens quick search field or focuses it if already open. Search persists between sessions. **Suggestion:** Bind to a shortcut key like `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+S` for quick file filtering
- `Notebook Navigator: Search in vault root` Selects the vault root folder and opens search (requires `Show root folder` enabled)

**Selection**

- `Notebook Navigator: Select next file` Moves selection to the next file in the current folder or tag view. Respects custom sort order. **Suggestion:** Bind to a shortcut key like `Option+Cmd+Right` to quickly go to the next file in list
- `Notebook Navigator: Select previous file` Moves selection to the previous file in the current folder or tag view. Respects custom sort order. **Suggestion:** Bind to a shortcut key like `Option+Cmd+Left` to quickly go to the previous file in list

**Layout & display**

- `Notebook Navigator: Toggle dual pane layout` Toggle single/dual-pane layout (desktop). **Suggestion:** Bind to a shortcut key like `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+A` to quickly switch between single-pane and dual-pane layout
- `Notebook Navigator: Toggle descendants` Toggle subfolders / descendants notes display for folders and tags. **Suggestion:** Bind to a shortcut key like `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+D` to quickly toggle display of notes from subfolders / descendants
- `Notebook Navigator: Toggle hidden items` Show or hide hidden folders, tags, and notes
- `Notebook Navigator: Toggle tag sort` Toggle between alphabetical and frequency-based tag sorting
- `Notebook Navigator: Toggle compact mode` Toggle list mode between standard and compact
- `Notebook Navigator: Collapse / expand all items` Collapse or expand all items based on the current state. When `Keep selected item expanded` is enabled (default on), all folders except the current one will be collapsed. This is handy to keep the navigation tree tidy when searching for documents

**Calendar**

- `Notebook Navigator: Toggle calendar` Toggles calendar on or off. **Suggestion:** Bind to a shortcut key like `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+C` to quickly show the calendar
- `Notebook Navigator: Open daily note` Opens today's daily note based on calendar settings. Creates the note if it doesn't exist
- `Notebook Navigator: Open weekly note` Opens the current weekly note. Creates the note if it doesn't exist
- `Notebook Navigator: Open monthly note` Opens the current monthly note. Creates the note if it doesn't exist
- `Notebook Navigator: Open quarterly note` Opens the current quarterly note. Creates the note if it doesn't exist
- `Notebook Navigator: Open yearly note` Opens the current yearly note. Creates the note if it doesn't exist

**File operations**

**Important:** Obsidian has no context of "current folder or tag", so when creating notes in Obsidian by default they are created in the root folder, same folder as current file, or a specific folder. When working with Notebook Navigator you always want to create new notes in the currently selected folder or tag, so the first thing you should do is bind `Cmd/Ctrl+N` to `Notebook Navigator: Create new note` so new notes are always created in the currently selected folder or tag. The same also applies to moving and deleting files. This is why you should use these commands instead of the built-in Obsidian commands when using Notebook Navigator.

- `Notebook Navigator: Create new note` Create note in currently selected folder. **Suggestion:** Bind `Cmd/Ctrl+N` to this command (unbind from Obsidian's default "Create new note" first)
- `Notebook Navigator: Create new note from template` Create note from template in currently selected folder (requires Templater)
- `Notebook Navigator: Move files` Move selected files to another folder. Selects next file in current folder
- `Notebook Navigator: Convert to folder note` Create a folder matching the file name and move the file inside as the folder note
- `Notebook Navigator: Set as folder note` Rename the active file to its folder note name
- `Notebook Navigator: Detach folder note` Detach the folder note in the selected folder and rename it
- `Notebook Navigator: Pin all folder notes` Pin all folder notes in all folders. Command is only visible when folder notes are enabled and at least one unpinned folder note exists
- `Notebook Navigator: Delete files` Delete selected files. Selects next file in current folder

**Tag operations**

- `Notebook Navigator: Add tag to selected files` Dialog to add tag to selected files. Supports creating new tags
- `Notebook Navigator: Remove tag from selected files` Dialog to remove specific tag. Removes immediately if only one tag
- `Notebook Navigator: Remove all tags from selected files` Clear all tags from selected files with confirmation

**Maintenance**
