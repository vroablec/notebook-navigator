# Notebook Navigator — Introduction Video Script

## 1 NOTEBOOK NAVIGATOR

Hey there, and welcome! Thank you so much for checking out Notebook Navigator.

[short pause]

In this video I'll walk you through everything you need to get started... from installation to mastering the two-pane interface.

[pause]

Here's the vault we'll be working with today. It's called Demo, and it has two folders: AI and Photo. I've also set up some tags like ai slash openai, ai slash anthropic, and a few more.

[short pause]

Let's get started.

[pause]

---

## 2 INSTALLATION

First, let's install Notebook Navigator.

[short pause]

Open Obsidian settings by clicking the gear icon in the bottom left corner.

[short pause]

Go to Community plugins in the sidebar. If this is your first community plugin, you'll need to click Turn on community plugins and confirm.

[pause]

Now click Browse, and search for Notebook.

[short pause]

There it is! Click Install. [short pause] Then click Enable. Close the window.

[short pause]

As you can see, the left panel has now changed and all our files will now be showing with text previews, tags and thumbnail previews. On the first launch Notebook Navigator will generate thumbnails for all your notes with PDF documents, images or YouTube links, so you will see a notice while the cache is being built.

[pause]

Let's get started!

[pause]

---

## 3 INTERFACE

Depending on the initial width of the left panel you will either see a single pane interface like this, or a dual-pane interface. [short pause] To switch to dual-pane mode from single-pane mode, first switch to navigation pane by pressing the back button in the top left corner. Then increase the size of the left panel and click the "Show dual panes" button. Resize the panes if needed, especially if you do not see the list pane.

[pause]

The interface is split into two panes. On the left is the NAVIGATION pane. This is where you'll find your folders, tags, shortcuts, and recent notes.

[short pause]

On the right is the LIST pane. When you select a folder or tag on the left, its notes appear here on the right.

[pause]

Let me click the AI folder. See how the list updates? Now let me click Photo. Different files.

[short pause]

Tags work the same way. I'll click the tag ai slash anthropic, and now I see all notes with that tag.

[pause]

At the top of the list pane, you'll find controls for search, sort, appearance, and this important toggle... Show notes from subfolders and descendants.

[pause]

---

## 4 DESCENDANTS

Let's talk about this descendants toggle... it's REALLY important and it's enabled by default.

[pause]

When it's ON, selecting a folder shows notes from that folder AND all its subfolders. Same with tags... you'll see notes from the selected tag and all child tags.

[short pause]

When it's OFF, you only see notes that are DIRECTLY in that folder or have EXACTLY that tag.

[pause]

If you ever think "why am I seeing so many files?"... check this toggle first.

[pause]

---

## 5 SINGLE PANE

If you prefer the single pane layout, there are some settings to customize it.

[short pause]

Open Notebook Navigator settings and go to the General tab. Under "Desktop appearance", you'll find a setting called "Dual-pane orientation". Change it to "Vertical split". This will show the navigation and list pane above each other instead of next to each other.

[pause]

Next, enable Compact mode. Go into Settings, List pane, Appearance and change Default list mode to Compact. This makes Notebook Navigator feel more like a file browser... great for smaller screens.

[short pause]

Finally, go into Settings, Notes and enable Icons by file type in the Icon section. This adds category icons next to your files based on their type... images, PDFs, canvases, bases, and more. It's a quick way to see what kind of content you have at a glance.

[pause]

Now let me quickly change the interface back to dual pane mode.

[pause]

## 6 SHORTCUTS & RECENT

The navigation pane has four main sections.

[short pause]

At the top, you have SHORTCUTS. This is your quick access area... pin your most-used notes, folders, tags, or even saved searches here. Let me show you how this works.

[short pause]

You can pin files, folders or tags by just dragging them to the shortcuts area like this...

[short pause]

Or you can add them by right clicking and selecting add to shortcuts, like this.

[short pause]

Below that is RECENT NOTES, which automatically tracks files you've recently opened.

[short pause]

Then you have your FOLDERS tree, and finally your TAGS tree.

[pause]

And a pro tip: There are commands to open shortcuts one through nine directly, so you can bind them to keyboard shortcuts like Control-1 for instant access!

[pause]

---

## 7 REORDER

Don't like the default order? Maybe you want tags to be shown above your folders? You can customize it!

[short pause]

Click the "Reorder navigation" button in the toolbar.

[pause]

Now you can change the order of items in the navigation pane. Want tags above folders? Just click the arrow to move it.

[short pause]

You can also reorder your ROOT folders and ROOT tags to put your most-used items at the top.

[short pause]

When using a custom sort order new items are placed at the bottom of each category. If you want to reset to alphabetical order, just click the reset button.

[short pause]

Click "Done reordering" toolbar button when you're finished.

[pause]

Another pro tip: Tags can also be sorted based on frequency, just go into settings and the Folders & tags tab to change it.

[pause]

---

## 8 LIST MODES

The list pane has two display modes: Standard and Compact.

[short pause]

In STANDARD mode, each note shows its title, modification date, a preview of the content, and... if available... a feature image thumbnail.

[pause]

[excited] One of my favorite features is that Notebook Navigator automatically generates thumbnails from the first image in your notes. It even works with external images, YouTube thumbnails, PDFs, and Excalidraw drawings!

[pause]

In COMPACT mode, you just see the title... great for maximum density.

[short pause]

Click Appearance to customize. You can adjust how many lines of title and preview text to show, and enable grouping by date or by subfolder.

[short pause]

The best part? These settings can be customized PER FOLDER and PER TAG. To change the default appearance for all folders you have extensive options in settings. You can change almost everything about how notes appear in the list pane.

[pause]

---

## 9 SORTING

Like appearance, sorting works on two levels.

[short pause]

You have a DEFAULT sort order that applies everywhere, and you can set CUSTOM overrides for specific folders or tags.

[short pause]

Click Sort to see your options: modified date, created date, or alphabetical... ascending or descending.

[pause]

If you set a custom sort for a folder, it's remembered. Navigate away and come back... your preference is still there. Appearance and sort order settings are also synced between all your devices.

[short pause]

To clear a custom sort, just select Default.

[pause]

---

## 10 SEARCH

Search lets you filter the current folder or tag.

[short pause]

Just type to search by filename. Add a HASHTAG to filter by tag.

[short pause]

You can also combine different search filters. For example, "sony hashtag 50mm" finds notes with "sony" in the name AND the 50mm tag. In the navigation pane you can see all tags currently used by the current filter.

[short pause]

Use an EXCLAMATION MARK to exclude notes. "Exclamation hashtag 50mm" hides all notes with the tag 50mm. To hide all notes that have tags you can just put "Exclamation hashtag".

[pause]

Here's a power tip: In the list pane, you can Command-click or Control-click on a tag chip to add it to your search filter. Hold Shift for an OR search.

[pause]

Found a search you use often? Save it as a shortcut! Click the save icon next to the search field, give it a name, and it'll appear in your shortcuts section for one-click access.

[pause]

---

## 11 TAGS

Tags in Notebook Navigator are fully interactive.

[short pause]

To ADD a tag to notes, just drag them onto a tag in the navigation pane. This works with multiple notes too!

[short pause]

To REMOVE all tags from notes, drag them onto Untagged.

[pause]

You can also reorganize your tag hierarchy with drag and drop.

[short pause]

Drag a tag onto another tag to RENAME or NEST it. This opens a rename dialog where you can confirm the change.

[short pause]

Want to promote a nested tag to the root level? Drag it onto the Tags header.

[short pause]

All tag changes update your actual note files... nothing is stored separately.

[pause]

---

## 12 PINNING

Pinning keeps important notes at the top of your list.

[short pause]

Right-click a note and select Pin note. It moves to a pinned section at the top. You can also use one of the quick actions button to quickly pin notes.

[pause]

Here's something useful to know: folder pins and tag pins are SEPARATE. A note can be pinned in your folder view but not in your tag view, or vice versa, or both. This gives you flexibility to organize differently depending on how you're browsing.

[pause]

---

## 13 CUSTOMIZE

Notebook Navigator has tons of options to visually customize your vault.

[short pause]

Right-click any folder to access Change icon, Change color, and Change background.

[short pause]

By default the icon picker includes Lucide icons and emojis. To download additional icons go into Notebook Navigator settings, click Icon packs, and download the icon packs you want. These icon packs are downloaded from the public GitHub repo for Notebook Navigator, and you can choose from popular icon packs like Font Awesome, Material Icons, and Bootstrap icons.

[pause]

Want to apply the same style to multiple items? Use the Style menu. Copy a style from one folder, then paste it onto others.

[pause]

You can also customize individual files... right-click any note to change its icon or color.

[short pause]

For power users, there are settings to automatically assign icons based on filename patterns or file types. Go into Settings and the Notes tab and you will find "Icons by file name" and "Icons by file type". You can also enable "Use frontmatter metadata" to read filename, color and icon information from frontmatter. If this setting is enabled you can also save icon and color information to frontmatter.

[pause]

---

## 14 SETTINGS

There's a LOT you can customize in settings.

[short pause]

Open Obsidian settings and find Notebook Navigator.

[short pause]

The General tab covers layout options, dual pane orientation, and filtering.

[short pause]

Navigation pane and List pane tabs let you fine-tune each side of the interface.

[short pause]

The Notes tab controls how individual notes appear... preview text, dates, tags, and feature images.

[short pause]

And Icon packs is where you enable additional icon libraries.

[short pause]

I won't go through every option... just explore and read the descriptions to see what they do!

[pause]

## 15 GET STARTED

That's Notebook Navigator! A two-pane interface that makes navigating large vaults intuitive and fast.
