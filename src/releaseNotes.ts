/**
 * Release Notes System
 *
 * This module manages the "What's new" feature that shows users what has changed
 * between plugin versions. The system works as follows:
 *
 * 1. On plugin load, it compares the current version with the last shown version
 * 2. If version increased, it shows all release notes between versions
 * 3. If downgraded or same version, it shows the latest 5 releases
 * 4. Individual releases can be marked with showOnUpdate: false to skip auto-display
 * 5. Users can always manually access release notes via plugin settings
 *
 * The lastShownVersion is stored in plugin settings to track what the user has seen.
 */

/**
 * Formatting in release notes
 *
 * Supported inline formats in both info and list items:
 * - Bold text: **text**
 * - Critical emphasis (red + bold): ==text==
 * - Markdown link: [label](https://example.com)
 * - Auto-link: https://example.com
 *
 * Not supported:
 * - Italics, headings, inline code, HTML
 *
 * Writing rules:
 * - Use factual, concise statements
 * - Avoid benefit language and subjective adjectives
 * - Keep to the categories: new, improved, changed, fixed
